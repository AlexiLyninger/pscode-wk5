// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

x = 5
y = 7
sum = (x+y)

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

if int % 2 == 0 then
	print "Even"
else
	print "Odd"
	

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

#Read in numbers
a = input("type number for a: ")
b = input("type number for b: ")
c = input("type number for c: ")
d = input("type number for d: ")
e = input("type number for e: ")

#Find average
avg = (a+b+c+d+e)/5
print avg

#Find minimum
if (a<(b,c,d,e)) then
	print (The smallest number is a)
else if (b<(a,c,d,e)) then
	print (The smallest number is b)
else if (c<(a,b,d,e)) then
	print (The smallest number is c)
else if (d<(a,b,c,e)) then
	print (The smallest number is d)
else (e<(a,b,c,d)) then
	print (The smallest number is e)

#Find maximum
if (a>(b,c,d,e)) then
	print (The largest number is a)
else if (b>(a,c,d,e)) then
	print (The largest number is b)
else if (c>(a,b,d,e)) then
	print (The largest number is c)
else if (d>(a,b,c,e)) then
	print (The largest number is d)
else (e>(a,b,c,d)) then
	print (The largest number is e)
